# TweetDucker
A sample [Fabric] app for Android.

![](doc/login.png?raw=true)


## Credentials
The Fabric integrations require a `app/fabric.properties` file containing secrets which has not been
included in this repository. Use the [Fabric plugin] to onboard or copy/paste your own keys into
this file.

It should have the following format:

    apiSecret=<64 character hex string>
    twitterPluginId=<14 character hex string>

The Login with Twitter and Twitter API functionality requires a Twitter Application consumer key
and secret to be provided in `app/src/main/assets/app.properties`. This is a Java properties file
and should have the following format.

    twitter_key=<24 character base 64 string>
    twitter_secret=<50 character base 64 string>
